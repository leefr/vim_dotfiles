It needs the entire namespace.\n* Recompilation\n    - The project needs to recompile to show latest docs\n      this is not taken care of by this plugin.\n* on todo list: Smarter namespace selection from \"carret\" etc.\n* on todo list: Make sure it runs on Mac -x (totally not tested)\n  - Probably needs absolute path resolving to elixir iex commands\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Psvensso/elixir-docs/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Psvensso/elixir-docs#readme","_id":"elixir-docs@0.1.6","_shasum":"67ff20f0f8ebfe7fd364ef2bf548e51769e412c2","_resolved":"file:../d-1151111-5439-gf4za0/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151111-5439-gf4za0/package.tgz"}
