Edit > Preferences (Ctrl+,)\n2.  Install > Search \"linter-elixirc\" > Install\n\n## Settings\n\nPlugin should work with default settings. If not:\n\n1.  Edit > Preferences (Ctrl+,)\n\n2.  Packages > Search \"linter-elixirc\" > Settings\n\n3.  `elixirc path` option - use `which elixirc` to find path. ie.\n    `/usr/local/bin/elixirc`\n\n4.  `mix path` option - use `which mix` to find path. ie. `/usr/local/bin/mix`\n\n5.  `always use elixirc` option - leave it disabled, unless `mix compile` is too slow.\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you open folder with mix project (`mix.exs` exists in project's root\nfolder), linter will use `mix compile` to include all dependencies, unless you\nenable \"Always use elixirc\" setting.\n\nIf you open single file, linter will use `elixirc`. This will try to find\ndependencies in a place where mix projects do (\\_build/dev/lib/\\*/ebin). If\ndependency path is different, then every external dependency will trigger\nCompileError.\n\nSince `*.ex` files are not compiled by `mix compile`, they are always linted\nusing `elixirc`.\n\n[linter]: https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter \"Linter\"\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-elixirc/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-elixirc#readme","_id":"linter-elixirc@1.1.10","_shasum":"ae3aa2e12f9f0473e8a8a81b3baf10b567b0ff6c","_resolved":"file:../d-11673-21909-5e6ycw/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11673-21909-5e6ycw/package.tgz"}
